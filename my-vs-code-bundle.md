## VS Code
Usually you want to use something fast, functional and especially free text editor for code/markdown/text editing. There are a lot of options such as [Atom][link_atom], [Sublime Text][link_sublime_text] and [Brackets][link_brackets], but for now I prefer to use [VS Code][link_vs_code]. It is designed to be extensible through different plugins and themes to fit any requirement that you may have and at the same time community actively creates and supports a huge amount of these plugins and here is my plugins bundle:
- `Atom One Dark Theme` - my lovely theme for any kind of text: js, markdown, simple text writing and other.
- `Code Spell Checker` - helps me a lot to avoid typos and gaps in my English.
- `Docker` - file creation, linting, autocomplete and other useful helpers for working with Docker.
- `Ember JS (ES6) and Handlebars code snippets` - self-explanatory name :-).
- `ESLint` - awesome ESLint integration into VS Code, also `autofix on save` is supported. Should say, that this implementation is the fastest that I was used.
- `file-icons` - simple file icons preset, especially `Colourless` version.
- `Git History` - good tool for file history viewing, also has UI integration.
- `Jenkins Support` - in case if you work with Jenkins pipelines, it brings syntax highlighting.
- `Markdown All in One` - very useful plugin for markdown writers.
- `npm` - small npm integration.
- `GitLens` - a nice plugin that extends git support with different tooltips and hints.

Hope you find some useful plugins in this list! Have a nice coding! ;-)
